# React Parent-Child Communication Example

This is a basic React app showing how data can be passed between a parent and a child component.

## Features
- The Parent component displays a message and updates based on data from the Child component.
- The Child component sends data to the parent using a function passed as a prop.

## How It Works
- The parent manages a state (`childName`).
- The child component calls a function from the parent to update `childName`.
- The parent displays the updated `childName` value.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the app:
   ```bash

   ```
